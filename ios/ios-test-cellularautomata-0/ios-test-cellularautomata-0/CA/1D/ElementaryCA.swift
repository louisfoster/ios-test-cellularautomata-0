 TODO:
 
 States: 0, 2, 4 are "dead"
 State: 1, 3, 5 are "alive"
 
 These rules could be updated as so:
 1. If was dead (0) and is now alive, it is a baby (1)
 2. If was a baby (1) and is now dead, it is an angel (2)
 3. If was a baby (1) and is still alive, it is a person (3)
 4. If was an angel (2) and is now alive, it is a person (3)
 5. If was an angel (2) and is still dead, it is now dead (0)
 6. If was a person (3) and is now dead, it is a corpse (4)
 7. If was a corpse (4) and is now alive, it is a zombie (5)
 8. If was a corpse (4) and is still dead, it is now dead (0)
 9. If was a zombie (5) and is still alive, it is now a corpse (4)
 10. If was a zombie (5) and is now dead, it is now dead (0)
